# 📌 Android PIN Brute-Forcer (Legal Use Only)

🔒 **DISCLAIMER: This tool is strictly for ethical penetration testing and security research. Unauthorized access to devices you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal. Use this responsibly!**  

## 🚀 About This Project  
This repository contains pre-generated PIN lists for **brute-forcing Android lock screens** using **Kali NetHunter** devices. These lists cover **3, 4, 5, and 6-digit PINs** commonly used for device security testing.  

💡 **This is intended for cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and security researchers** to assess the strength of numeric PINs and help users improve their device security.  

## 📁 Files Included  
✔️ `3_digit_pins.txt` – All possible 3-digit PINs (000-999)  
✔️ `4_digit_pins.txt` – All possible 4-digit PINs (0000-9999)  
✔️ `5_digit_pins.txt` – All possible 5-digit PINs (00000-99999)  
✔️ `6_digit_pins.txt` – All possible 6-digit PINs (000000-999999)  

## 📲 Requirements  
- 🛠 **Kali NetHunter** (running on a compatible Android phone)  
- ⚡ ADB & Fastboot tools (for manual PIN input automation)  
- 🐍 Python (optional, for scripting brute-force automation)  

## 🔓 Cracking Android PINs with Kali NetHunter  
You can use **Kali NetHunter** to brute-force Android PINs by leveraging ADB and PIN lists. One powerful tool for this process is **Android PIN Bruteforce**, available here:  

🔗 [Android PIN Bruteforce - GitHub](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/Android-PIN-Bruteforce)  

### How It Works  
1️⃣ **Enable ADB on the target device** (requires USB debugging or recovery mode access)  
2️⃣ **Connect Kali NetHunter to the device via ADB**  
3️⃣ **Use a brute-force script** (such as Android PIN Bruteforce) to attempt PIN entry using the included PIN lists  
4️⃣ **Analyze the results** and provide security recommendations  

⚠️ **Make sure you have explicit permission before attempting to brute-force any device!**  

## 🔐 Legal & Ethical Use  
✅ **Allowed Use Cases**:  
✔️ Penetration testing on your own device  
✔️ Security research with explicit permission  
✔️ Education and learning about cybersecurity  

🚨 **Prohibited Use** (Illegal & Unauthorized Activities)  
❌ Hacking or attempting unauthorized access to devices  
❌ Bypassing security measures without consent  
❌ Using for unlawful purposes  

## 🛠 Contributions  
Pull requests are welcome for improving **PIN datasets, automation scripts, or security insights**. Let's work together to **enhance cybersecurity** ethically!
