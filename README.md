# 📌 Android PIN Brute-Forcer (Legal Use Only)

🔒 **DISCLAIMER: This tool is strictly for ethical penetration testing and security research. Unauthorized access to devices you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal. Use this responsibly!**  

## 🚀 About This Project  
This repository contains pre-generated PIN lists for **brute-forcing Android lock screens** using **Kali NetHunter** devices. These lists cover **3, 4, 5, and 6-digit PINs** commonly used for device security testing.  

💡 **This is intended for cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and security researchers** to assess the strength of numeric PINs and help users improve their device security.  

## 📁 Files Included  
✔️ `3_digit_pins.txt` – All possible 3-digit PINs (000-999)  
✔️ `4_digit_pins.txt` – All possible 4-digit PINs (0000-9999)  
✔️ `5_digit_pins.txt` – All possible 5-digit PINs (00000-99999)  
✔️ `6_digit_pins.txt` – All possible 6-digit PINs (000000-999999)  

## 📲 Requirements  
- 🛠 **Kali NetHunter** (running on a compatible Android phone)  
- ⚡ ADB & Fastboot tools (for manual PIN input automation)  
- 🐍 Python (optional, for scripting brute-force automation)  

## 🏗 Usage Instructions  
⚠️ **Ensure you have legal authorization before testing any device.**  

1️⃣ **Transfer PIN lists** to your Kali NetHunter device  
2️⃣ Use **ADB commands** or a custom script to attempt PIN entry  
3️⃣ Analyze **PIN complexity and effectiveness**  
4️⃣ **Advise on stronger authentication** (e.g., alphanumeric passwords)  

## 🔐 Legal & Ethical Use  
✅ **Allowed Use Cases**:  
✔️ Penetration testing on your own device  
✔️ Security research with explicit permission  
✔️ Education and learning about cybersecurity  

🚨 **Prohibited Use** (Illegal & Unauthorized Activities)  
❌ Hacking or attempting unauthorized access to devices  
❌ Bypassing security measures without consent  
❌ Using for unlawful purposes  

## 🛠 Contributions  
Pull requests are welcome for improving **PIN datasets, automation scripts, or security insights**. Let's work together to **enhance cybersecurity** ethically!  

## 🤝 License
